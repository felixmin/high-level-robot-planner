# User-specific configuration overrides
# Copy this file to local.yaml (in this same directory) and customize for your environment.
#
# This file is gitignored so your local paths won't be committed.
#
# The config is automatically included (as optional) by experiment configs that need it.
# You can also override via CLI:
#   python scripts/2_train_laq.py experiment=laq_oxe_local logging.root_dir=/my/path

# Logging paths (where to store run outputs)
logging:
  # Base directory for all run artifacts (runs/, cache/, etc.)
  # Set this to a directory with plenty of storage space.
  # Examples:
  #   - Local: /home/username/experiments/hlrp
  #   - LRZ DSS: /dss/dssmcmlfs01/pn57pi/pn57pi-dss-0001/username
  root_dir: null

# Cache directory for large downloads (HF hub weights, torch hub, TFDS cache, etc.).
# If relative, resolved against `logging.root_dir` if set, else project root.
paths:
  cache_dir: cache

# Optional: point the local OpenX indexed adapter at your OXE tar mirror root.
data:
  adapter:
    openx_local:
      root: /mnt/data/oxe

# Optional: override cluster container image per user.
# Most experiments include this file as optional `/user_config: local`,
# so this value cleanly overrides `cluster.container.image`.
cluster:
  container:
    image: null            # e.g. /dss/.../enroot/lam.sqsh
