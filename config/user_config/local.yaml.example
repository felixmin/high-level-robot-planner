# The config is automatically included (as optional) by experiment configs that need it.
# You can also override via CLI:
#   python scripts/2_train_laq.py experiment=laq_oxe_all_val_3 logging.root_dir=/my/path

# Logging paths (where to store run outputs)
logging:
  # Base directory for all run artifacts (runs/, cache/, etc.)
  # Set this to a directory with plenty of storage space.
  # Examples:
  #   - Local: /home/username/experiments/hlrp
  #   - LRZ DSS: /dss/dssmcmlfs01/pn57pi/pn57pi-dss-0001/username
