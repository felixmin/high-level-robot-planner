# OXE Mixed Weighting Example
# Demonstrates mixed absolute mode: combine explicit weights with proportionate weighting
#
# Weight specification options:
# - Omitted or "proportionate": Share remaining weight by dataset size
# - Numeric (0.0-1.0): Exact sampling ratio (e.g., 0.3 = 30% of samples)
#
# Example below: bridge gets exactly 40%, remaining 60% split by size between others

    weight: 0.4                  # Explicit: exactly 40% of samples
    size: 1031130                # Precomputed: ~25.5k × 0.9 × 45 pairs (avoids TF init)

    offset: 10                   # 1 second at 10Hz
    # weight omitted = proportionate (share of remaining 60%)
