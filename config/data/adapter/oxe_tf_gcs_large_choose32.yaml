# @package data.adapter

# GCS streaming adapter tuned for *30+ datasets*:
# - Avoid per-dataset block prefetch (too expensive at high dataset count).
# - Use `choose_from_datasets` with a longer selector run-length to amortize
#   the occasional "cold switch" stall over many batches.

  - oxe_tf_gcs_fast_large
