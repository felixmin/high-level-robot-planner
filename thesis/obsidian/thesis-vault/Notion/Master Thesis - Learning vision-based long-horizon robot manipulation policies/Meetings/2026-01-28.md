# Progress

- Fixed cosmos reason2 run → seems to work
- Integrated latent action model in lerobot
- Ran a latent action extension run with smol

# Thoughts

- Smol
    - Normally VLM is pretrained and frozen
    - I finetuned the VLM
→ Maybe that makes it worse?
    - Should we build a custom smol version where the action expert uses the final hidden state instead of this interweaved approach?
→ 
- Why is smol already so good after so little steps comared to cosmos reason?

# Next steps

- Debug and finetune smol with different setups
-
