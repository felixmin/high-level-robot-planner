→ Basically this should also work for us?

Limitations:

- Probably doesnt work for complex long-horizon structures
    - They only build small objects with easy parts
- 

They dont need the assembly instructions

→ Does this make it separate problems?

Problem 1: Use GenAI to come up with a design based on the available parts

Problem 2: Come up with step-by-step assembly plan?

Problem 3: Control the robot?
