Diffusion for decision making

End2end  poor performance with rich contact

RL works well but low sample efficiency

Diffusion is superior for modeling complex data distributions

Poor performance of diffusion in complex rich tasks

## Method

Diffusion

Hierarchical policy learning


Design choice contact points
