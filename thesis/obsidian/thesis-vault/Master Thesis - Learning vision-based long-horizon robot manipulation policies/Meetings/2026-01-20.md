# Progress

- First small Cosmos-Reason2 finetuning run
    - No results yet
- Improved dataloader form ~1 it/s to 3 it/s

# Thoughts

- Is cosmos-reason2 really the right one?
    - No results from other people for comparison
    - No finetuning tutorials
- What would be an alternative
    - OpenVLA (OFT)

# Next steps

- Finish performance improvements
- Run bigger / longer VLA training runs
