1. add missing libraries (tensorflow and ??) to requirements and container and add requirements to repo.

1.5 ? fix open issues from gemini analysis

2. do we currently have perception loss outside the model? i think so… clean the repo so that the model only exposes a loss and nothing else. perception loss outside model is a breach of this!!
-> add this to the claude file !!
3. refactor the validations to have validations run on language table only and we can see how language table performance changes with bridge added to the dataset.
-> claude instruction

prompt:

we are now running mixed dataset runs on the lrz cluster. i want to draw a comparison on how the results in language table
improve or change with adding bridge. for that we need to be able to run evaluations only on language table even though running
with bridge and language table. make sure our setup allows that. i think best would be list validaiton strategies with exactly
the data bucket that they should be performed on if that makes sense? if its better to have filters per strategy thats also ok.
please for now thoroughly analyze what we have, how it is used etc to find out how we can implement this properly. we want a
expandable, clean, dry, maintainable architecture but now overengineer everything. but its ok to have a little bit of overhead if
its much cleaner. please analyze and write a report. if there is one option explain what to do and how if there is multiple
please briefly outline how they work, pros/cons. dont be overly verbose, rather brief, concise but still complete.

### 1. Hardcoded `language_table` filtering in validation strategies (UNCOMMITTED CHANGES)

**Location**: `packages/laq/validation.py` (lines 1538, 1701, 1871, 2062)

**Analysis**: The filter `if meta.get("dataset_name") != "language_table": continue` breaks generic scatter strategies. Bridge has actions too but would be silently skipped.

**Decision**: Need bucket/dataset binding for strategies. Two options:

4. **Per-strategy dataset filter** (simple): Add `dataset_filter: List[str]` param to each scatter strategy
5. **Bucket-strategy binding** (already partially exists): Use existing `strategy_bucket_bindings` to route strategies to specific buckets

Option 2 is cleaner since bucket infrastructure exists. The binding would specify which buckets each strategy operates on.

**Status**: OPEN - Needs design decision on whether to use per-strategy filter or leverage bucket bindings.

6. integrate submitit launcher following the gemini analysis
-> claude instruction

see docs for detailed plan

7. add the 2 more datasets and tests for them

prompt:

we would like to add the rt1 and robonet datasets. can you please explore them, maybe get some samples from the bucket, check which fields are there etc and how they
have to be processed to fit our data scheme. also check if our data scheme fits these 2 datasets or if we have to make any adjustments. v1.0    RT-1 Robot Action
