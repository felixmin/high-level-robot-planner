- Use an existing diffusion policy setup from the lab
    - Provide latents as extra conditioning
→ Minimal extra effort for the low level policy



## Questions

- How much does the data mixture matter? (esp. in cross embodiment / environment)
- Using future robot states vs optical flow?

and maybe

I think most central would be feedback regarding our planned extension to expand the decoder for optical flow reconstruction, and to learn from their experiences and insights.

Also, it would be interesting to hear if they discovered other promising and underexplored directions.

Practically 

- Did they discover any intermediate metric that could compare the quality of action latents without the necessity to perform full end-to-end training?
- What roles does data mixture play?


- Having multiple decoders vs the single best one? Tradeoffs? When is which approach better?

- What are the teacher forcing inconsistencies in GO-1 ?

- look at their paper… they exactly measure the impact of scale on the cross embodiment learning? how can they know at which point the human and robot representations are “merging”
→ Can we do the same experiment?
→ Can we use the same analysis for other topics?
- Adding human data vs adding robot data… whats the benefit of each?
- To have an adequate comparison do image inpainting

- 

- Find good data mixtures
    - What mixture is optimal
    - are there certain requirements regarding the mixture
    - how much teleop data do you need?

run an experiment similar to this…

have in domain data and human data

use 10% of only robot or both

then 20, 30,50, 100

you see if human transfer works from a certain dataset size if the bars start to drift apart
